# TrieStructure
My implementation of a simple trie structure using lists for data storage

The main idea came from this code snippet: [http://pythonfiddle.com/python-trie-implementation/](http://pythonfiddle.com/python-trie-implementation/)
I wanted to make something similar but based on lists instead of dictionaries (just for the sake of fun). I've used Pylint for code linting, and Pytest for the unit tests
